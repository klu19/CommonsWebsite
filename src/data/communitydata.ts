    description: "The Medical-Debt Navigation Desk (MD-NAV) is a student-run, privacy-first service that helps Maryland patients resolve hospital bills. We screen each case for free or reduced-cost care using income and household size, request income-based payment plans (~5% of monthly income) when needed, and audit insured bills for No Surprises Act protections. Our team prepares and submits the right forms, asks hospitals/collectors to pause billing and collections during review, and tracks every case to resolution. If a lawsuit or urgent collection issue appears, we make a warm referral to legal-aid partners. MD-NAV provides education and paperwork support (not legal advice), operates at no cost to patients, and measures impact through dollars canceled, approvals, and lawsuits avoided.",
