    title: "Reconsidering ACA §6001: The Future of Physician-Owned Hospitals ",
    description: "In partnership with the AANS/CNS Washington Office, The Commons Group is evaluating whether federal restrictions on physician-owned hospitals (POHs) under ACA §6001 still serve patients in today’s healthcare landscape. The brief analyzes cost, quality, access, workforce, and referral integrity across ownership models to test the need for continued limits on POHs. The project will present evidence-based legislative options to modernize policy while safeguarding equity, competition, and patient trust.",
