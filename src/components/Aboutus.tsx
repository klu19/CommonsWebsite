The Commons Group is a nonâ€“partisan health policy think tank dedicated to ensuring that the
voice of the common person is represented in meaningful policy change. Too often, everyday
communities are excluded from meaningful participation in shaping decisions that directly affect
their lives. By connecting emerging leaders with policymakers, we strive to make policy more
accessible, equitable, and responsive to the people it serves.    </p>
